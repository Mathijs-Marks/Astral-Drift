Welcome to Astral Drift!

## Contributing
Any team members contributing to the project, take heed of the following GIT workflow practices:

### Development
#### Start working on a feature/bug
When developing on a feature, bug, etc. One should create a branch off of the Development Branch.
When giving the branch a name, prefix your branch name with either feature or bug, depending on what you're working on, followed with the name of your branch.
There the team member can work on the feature/bug until it is finished.

#### Merging back to Development
When the feature/bug is finished, notify your team members so that they can Peer review your work.
This is done by creating a Pull Request so that another team member can do the Peer review.
As soon as your work is reviewed, the reviewer will merge your work back to Development.

### Releasing
When a sufficient amount of features or bugfixes have been tested and are ready to be released, a pull request is created to merge back to Release.
Two team members will review all of the work that is being merged back to Release to ensure that any merge conflicts are fixed.
Then, the work can be merged. After merging, the reviewers should test the release product and fix any after-merge errors.
